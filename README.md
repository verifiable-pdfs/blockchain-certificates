blockchain-certificates
=======================

This project allows an institution to issue digital certificates. It creates pdf certificate files and issues a hash representing those files into the Bitcoin network's blockchain. It can do so in two ways; one using an index file to aggregate the certificates' hashes and the other that does not require an index file. The former is the method used in the past and we do **recommend using the new method** as it supersedes the old ones. The only advantage of the old process over the new is that it is easier to verify manually.
